# Non Deterministic Text Clock
## Inspiration

## Description
A real time clock displayed in the terminal in a fancy way. Uses random text generation to act as the background, and the clock numbers themselves with color included. The code files clock_shapes.cpp, clock_time.cpp, and random_text.cpp are modified and combined into ND_clock.cpp to create the final display.
## Updates
1. Got idea/inspired and wrote random text generator which generates a fixed size block of random characters, then wrote a basic clock using ctime.
2. Implemented a basic idea of how I want to display the clock text and color scheme (may change later).
3. Clock now kind of works, but it is crooked. I need to fix some unknown spacing issue.

4. Clock is now working correctly.

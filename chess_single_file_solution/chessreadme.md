**About the project**

After a few months of on and off work with the little free time I had, I finally finished my chess cmd line project in c++. It works great and allows you to have 
full chess functionality including castling and en passant. There is also a check for checkmate and stalemate to see who won or caused a tie game.
It also includes a saveslot system which is infinitely expandable where you can save, load, or delete savefiles to saveslots. I learned a lot while making this
project like how to use fstream and more about vectors than I previously knew, but the worst part about making the project was testing every situation by hand.
This is the single file solution which is how I made it, however I will be making a multi file solution for better organization and so I can learn how I should
be organizing my bigger projects in the future. 

**Running the project**

As of now I can only upload the source code and not any build files so in order to run it, you need to make an empty c++ project and copy and paste the code.
In the future I will include build files so you can run it without having to make a new project.
